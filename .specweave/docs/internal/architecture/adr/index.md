# Architecture Decision Records

*Auto-generated by Intelligent Analyzer*

## Summary

- **Existing ADRs**: 0
- **Detected ADRs**: 0
- **Total**: 0

## No ADRs Detected

No architectural decisions were automatically detected. This can happen when:

1. **No consistent patterns** - Patterns need to appear in 2+ repositories or have high confidence
2. **New project** - Not enough code to infer architectural decisions
3. **Shallow analysis** - Try running with `--full-scan` for deeper analysis

### Create ADRs Manually

To document architectural decisions, create files in `adr/` following this template:

```markdown
# 0001-decision-title

**Status**: Accepted | Proposed | Deprecated | Superseded
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD

## Context
What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision?

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult because of this change?
```

Place ADR files in common locations for automatic detection:
- `docs/adr/`
- `architecture/decisions/`
- `adr/`
