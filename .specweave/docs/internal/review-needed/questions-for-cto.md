# Questions for CTO

*Auto-generated by Intelligent Analyzer*

1. We found 6 cases where different repos use different patterns for the same thing. Should we standardize?
2. Organization question: Single repository structure suggests this is either an early-stage startup or a small team - team boundaries may be more fluid than documented
3. Organization question: The Cloudflare Workers infrastructure could potentially be split into a separate repository as the platform scales
4. Organization question: The mobile application (edufeed-mobile/) may eventually become a separate repository with its own deployment pipeline
5. Organization question: External items from Jira (FS-001E) suggest there may be a product/backlog management process we don't have full visibility into
6. Organization question: The presence of multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Replicate, Hugging Face) suggests the team may be experimenting to find the best fit for different use cases
7. Organization question: WebRTC study rooms could potentially become a separate real-time service if scaling requirements demand it
8. Organization question: The video feature removal (US-001E) indicates active feature pruning/prioritization happening at the product level
