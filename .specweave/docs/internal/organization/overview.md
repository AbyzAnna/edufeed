# Organization Overview

*Generated 2025-12-31 | Confidence: medium*

## Summary

- **Teams**: 2
- **Microservices**: 4
- **Domains**: 4
- **Repositories**: 1
- **Structure Level**: 1-level (GitHub sync profiles configured)

## Uncertainties

- Single repository structure suggests this is either an early-stage startup or a small team - team boundaries may be more fluid than documented
- The Cloudflare Workers infrastructure could potentially be split into a separate repository as the platform scales
- The mobile application (edufeed-mobile/) may eventually become a separate repository with its own deployment pipeline
- External items from Jira (FS-001E) suggest there may be a product/backlog management process we don't have full visibility into
- The presence of multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Replicate, Hugging Face) suggests the team may be experimenting to find the best fit for different use cases
- WebRTC study rooms could potentially become a separate real-time service if scaling requirements demand it
- The video feature removal (US-001E) indicates active feature pruning/prioritization happening at the product level
